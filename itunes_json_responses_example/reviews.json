		"body": "Much better than the first game, and has alot more variety.<br/>My only problems with the game are -<br/><br/>1. Single use items are stupidly expensive - Why not make them a one time purchase, but you can only have one equipped at a time?<br/><br/>2. Giants are cheap - If you are back peddling from a horde and a reaper giant spawns behind you, thats pretty much game over. Very little chance to escape.<br/><br/>3. Shop is cluttered - Maybe split the shop into separate pages.<br/><br/>4. Cannot disable weapons once purchased - Maybe add an option to disable weapons untill you have upgraded them to a decent level.<br/><br/>Overall the game is very good. I look forward to seeing what comes over the next few updates.<br/><br/>Edit : two more annoyances -<br/><br/>5. It's too easy to destroy weapon crates with melee and explosives - considering the basic axe is useless, destroying crates is a bad idea. You have to stop swinging melee weapons when still 5 meters away, because 1-2 hits will destroy crates. And another time I was using a MG when a sheep spawned on me, auto equipped and insta fired, destroying the MG I had.<br/><br/>6. Previously saved levels are no longer saved - I beat most levels and they said &quot;saved&quot; in the shop, but now some of them have lost the Saved bit. I don't know what it means, or even if this is supposed to happen.",
